      To be able to use Google integration, you require an authorization Token.

      Serverboards can not provide one in the Community Edition as there are
      quotas involved.

      Get the API token credentials at [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
      at *Credentials / Create / Oauth API / Client Id / Web*

      The redirect URI must be the servername including protocol
      `https://example.com/static/serverboards.google.drive/auth.html`
